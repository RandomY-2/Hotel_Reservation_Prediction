# Hotel_Reservation_Prediction
 EDA & Classification on Kaggle Hotel Booking dataset

## Description

In this notebook, I did an exploratory data analysis and a classification using **Random Forest model** to Kaggles [Hotel Booking dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand). Specifically, I 

 - analyzed the **general shape and columns** of the dataset
 - examined the 2 columns that contain **missing values and if to impute or drop them** in the dataset
 - made **univariate data analysis with 9 customer-related columns** to acquire a general idea about the hotel customers, and 
 - **predict users' reservation cancellation** chance using Random Forest model. 
 
 After tuning the parameters and modifying the required_car_parking_spaces column, the model achieves a cross-validation accuracy of **86.82%**.
